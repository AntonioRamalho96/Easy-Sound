# Examples
To run the examples you will need pyaudio installed and numpy aswell. Also the examples must be in the same directory as the **Environment.py** script.

# recordTesting
This is the most clear example of what's the best about this library. It records and reproduces the record. For real, take a look at this small small script!

# playNotes
This is an example on how you can produce artificial sound, in this script we use the cosine function to produce some tones. It also plays the *Ode to Joy* :)
