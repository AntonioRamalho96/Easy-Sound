# Easy-Sound
Why isn't there any simple library to interact with audio inputs/outputs on the computer? Where you could just go like:
**record.startRecording()**

**record.stopRecording()**

for recording and then **record.playRecord()** to play it?? Well, now there is!

## What is Easy-Sound?
Easy sound is a library built on top of PyAudio to allow a simple use of audio interface. It aims to allow record, play, generate audiofiles and much more. It aslo allows to manipulate the audio as a list of integers in order to make signal processing easier!
